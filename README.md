# Project Overview: Basic Machine Learning Project

## Introduction
In this project, we'll explore the fundamentals of predictive modeling using simple techniques and tools. Our goal is to provide a beginner-friendly introduction to machine learning concepts and practical experience in developing a simple predictive model.

## Objective
The primary objective of the project is to introduce the concepts of machine learning and developing a simple predictive model. 

## Project Components
Our project consists of several key components, each designed to support participants in their learning journey:

1. **Data Exploration**: Involves in analyzing and visualizing data_sets to understand its structure for further decision-making.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Involves in  the process of cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling.
3. **Model Development**: Involves building a basic machine learning model using simple algorithms.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Involves evaluating the performance of the trained model using basic metrics.
5. **Documentation**: Involves documenting each step of the project.

## Technologies Used
The technologies and libraries used are,

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for model development and data analysis.
- **Scikit-learn (sklearn)**: A beginner-friendly machine learning library for building simple predictive models.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Providing a user-friendly interface for interactive coding and experimentation.
- **Markdown**: Creating easy-to-read documentation and README files using simple Markdown syntax.
